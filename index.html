                        Happy Birthday, Riya!<br><br>

I still can’t quite believe how we met—it feels like something out of a dream. I never imagined finding someone so special online, but somehow, fate had its own plan, and here we are. Even though there are miles between us, you’ve become such an essential part of my life.

Every night when we call and fall asleep together, it’s one of my favorite parts of the day. I know I always drift off first, and you get frustrated (which I love, by the way), but those moments are peaceful because of you. You make everything feel right—safe, warm, and happy.

I know you have moments where you feel unsure, but let me remind you—you are beautiful, in every way. It’s not just about how you look (though you are stunning), but your heart, your kindness, and the way you care. You are so special, and I feel unbelievably lucky to know you.

On your birthday, my wish for you is simple—endless happiness, unshakable success, and all the good things life has to offer. No matter where the future takes us, I will always cherish every moment we’ve shared. I can’t send you a gift right now, but one day, I’ll give you something that will always remind you of how much you mean to me.

Enjoy your day, my dear. You deserve every ounce of joy the world has to give.
